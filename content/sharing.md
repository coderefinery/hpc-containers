# Sharing reproducible containers

:::{objectives}
- Objective 1 - Know of some key best practices for creating reproducible containers
- Objective 2 - Know of some common version control services
- Objective 3 - ...
:::


## Reuse
(work in progress)

- Use available base containers
- Add your customisation on top of that

## Be specific
(work in progress)

- Use specific software version of everything
- Show file with/without software versions and explain behaviour in both cases


## Separate concerns
(work in progress)
- Only include things that are related to the computation and are general
- Input-data is typically not general
- User specific configuration 
 
## Use version control and public registries
- GitLab/GitHub for definition files
- Public registry for pre-built images
- Link the repo to the public registry

## Exercise

(work in progress)
